Samio CRM Server is built on [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), a modern PHP framework known for its elegant syntax, clear project structure, and rich ecosystem. Laravel provides a robust foundation for building scalable web applications and APIs, making it well-suited for a CRM backend.

In this project, Laravel is used to:

- Structure the application using MVC (Models, Views, Controllers) for clean separation of concerns.
- Expose RESTful API endpoints for the Samio CRM clients (web and/or mobile).
- Handle authentication, authorization, and user management using Laravel’s built-in security features.
- Interact with the database through Eloquent ORM for readable, expressive database queries.
- Manage configuration, environment variables, and application services through Laravel’s service container.
- Run background tasks (e.g., notifications, periodic jobs) using Laravel’s queue and scheduling system.

To work with the Samio CRM Server, you should be comfortable with:

- Basic PHP syntax and Composer for dependency management.
- Laravel’s directory structure (routes, controllers, models, migrations, etc.).
- Environment configuration using the `.env` file.
- Running Artisan commands for development workflows (migrations, seeding, queues, and more).

The following sections will guide you through setting up the Laravel application, configuring your environment, and running the Samio CRM Server locally for development.
